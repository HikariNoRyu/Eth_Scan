## 2. Making a testbed
### Create a New Project
Open GNS3 and create a new project. You can do this by clicking on "File" -> "New Blank Project".

### Add Devices to the Project
Drag and drop the devices you want to use into the main GNS3 workspace.
The devices we use for this testbed are:
* 2 Kali Linux CLI
* 1 Router
* 1 NAT

### Connect Devices
Connect the devices together by dragging a cable from the output port of one device to the input port of another.


### Save and Run the Testbed 
Once you have finished configuring the devices in your testbed, save the project. Then, click on the "Play" button to start the simulation. This will open a terminal for each device

### Connect Devices & Configure Devices
