## 2. Making a testbed
### Create a New Project
Open GNS3 and create a new project. You can do this by clicking on "File" -> "New Blank Project".

###Add Devices to the Project
Drag and drop the devices you want to use into the main GNS3 workspace.

###Connect Devices
Connect the devices together by dragging a cable from the output port of one device to the input port of another.

###Configure Devices
Double-click on a device to open the configuration window. From here, you can configure the device's settings, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and other network parameters.

###Save and Run the Testbed 
Once you have finished configuring the devices in your testbed, save the project. Then, click on the "Play" button to start the simulation.

###Test Connectivity
Verify connectivity between the devices by pinging the IP addresses of each device. You can also use other network diagnostic tools to troubleshoot and test your network configuration.
